# Shopping Cart

This is a shopping cart app that uses React routing and React testing.

To-Do:

- Let the sort and filter options work. Should be easy, would handle logic in the panel itself so it's modular then send it to App to update Cart.
- Make real-looking checkout box. I just put a button for now, which makes the whole page look super poverty.
- Maybe add initial state to the shop after leaving? It sounds like good practice but I'm not sure I even like that functionality
- Make the site responsive for mobile and other screen sizes. It holds up better than most of my projects for now though.
